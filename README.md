# Medical Insurance Cost Predictor Web App with Streamlit

## Project Description

This project is a web application designed to predict medical insurance costs based on user input. The application leverages machine learning models to provide accurate predictions and offers an intuitive user interface built with Streamlit.

### Key Features

- **Interactive User Interface**: Users can input their data through a web interface and receive real-time predictions.
- **Data Visualization**: The app includes visualizations to help users understand the input data and the resulting predictions.
- **Machine Learning Model**: The prediction model is trained on a dataset of medical insurance costs, ensuring reliable and accurate predictions.

### Tech Stack

- **Python**: The core programming language used for developing the application and implementing the machine learning model.
- **Streamlit**: A powerful framework used to create the web interface of the application. It allows for rapid development and deployment of interactive web apps.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Utilized for building and training the machine learning model. It provides various tools for model selection, training, and evaluation.
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis. It helps in handling and processing the dataset efficiently.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Libraries used for creating visualizations and plots to better understand the data and model predictions.

### Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection**: The dataset containing various features related to medical insurance costs is collected.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: The collected data is cleaned and preprocessed to make it suitable for training the machine learning model.
3. **Model Training**: A machine learning model is trained on the preprocessed data to predict insurance costs based on the input features.
4. **Web Application Development**: The trained model is integrated into a Streamlit web application, providing an interactive interface for users.
5. **Deployment**: The web application is deployed, making it accessible to users for real-time insurance cost predictions.
